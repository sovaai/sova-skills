$ * [@cmb({[<dict(sova_eng_what_is_q)>]}, {{star/--\}}, {sun}, {{sun/solar~/our galaxy/this galaxy/neighbo~/near~/--\}})] *
# The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometres (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth&#59 it accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.

# The the distance from Earth to the Sun is equal to about 150 million kilometres (93 million miles) or ~8 light minutes and determines the asronomical unit. The astronomical unit was originally conceived as the average of Earth's aphelion and perihelion&#59 however, since 2012 it has been defined as exactly 149597870700 m.

$ earth
$ our planet
$ * [@cmb({[<dict(sova_eng_what_is_q)>]}, {{planet~/--\}}, {earth~}, {{sun/solar~/our galaxy/this galaxy/neighbo~/near~/--\}})] *
# Earth is the planet we live on, the third planet from the Sun and the only known place in the universe to support life. Earth orbits around the sun at around 30 kilometres per second, in fact! It takes 365 days for the Earth to complete one full orbit. The Earthâ€™s diameter measures a huge 12,800 kilometres, making it the fifth largest planet.


//Mercury
$ mercury
$ * [@cmb({[<dict(sova_eng_what_is_q)>]}, {{planet~/--\}}, {mercury}, {{sun/solar~/our galaxy/this galaxy/neighbo~/near~/--\}})] *
# Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets.


//Venus
$ venus
$ * [@cmb({[<dict(sova_eng_what_is_q)>]}, {{planet~/--\}}, {venus}, {{sun/solar~/our galaxy/this galaxy/neighbo~/near~/--\}})] *
# Venus is the second planet from the sun and our closest planetary neighbor, the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. As a consequence, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System (243 days), and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus. Venus was the first planet explored by a spacecraft and was intensely studied early in the history of space exploration.


//Mars
$ mars
$ * [@cmb({[<dict(sova_eng_what_is_q)>]}, {{planet~/--\}}, {mars}, {{sun/solar~/our galaxy/this galaxy/neighbo~/near~/--\}})] *
# Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. It is often referred to as the "Red Planet" due to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface.


//Jupiter
$ jupiter
$ * [@cmb({[<dict(sova_eng_what_is_q)>]}, {{planet~/--\}}, {jupiter}, {{sun/solar~/our galaxy/this galaxy/neighbo~/near~/--\}})] *
# Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus.


//Saturn
$ saturn
$ * [@cmb({[<dict(sova_eng_what_is_q)>]}, {{planet~/--\}}, {saturn}, {{sun/solar~/our galaxy/this galaxy/neighbo~/near~/--\}})] *
# Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth&#59 however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system, which is composed mostly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust.


//Uranus
$ uran~
$ * [@cmb({[<dict(sova_eng_what_is_q)>]}, {{planet~/--\}}, {uranus}, {{sun/solar~/our galaxy/this galaxy/neighbo~/near~/--\}})] *
# Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus has it's ring system. Uranus has a unique configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit.


//Neptune
$ neptun~
$ * [@cmb({[<dict(sova_eng_what_is_q)>]}, {{planet~/--\}}, {neptun~}, {{sun/solar~/our galaxy/this galaxy/neighbo~/near~/--\}})] *
# Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. It is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere.
