# Jane Austen (1775 – 1817) was an English novelist known primarily for her six major novels, which interpret, critique, and comment upon the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. With the publication of the four novels including [inf]{Pride and Prejudice} (1813), she achieved modest success but only little fame in her lifetime since the books were published anonymously.
